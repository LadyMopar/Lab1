"""  # TODO: 1. PUT YOUR NAME IN THE ABOVE LINE.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# TODO: 2. Implement a program that accomplishes the specification
#   that is sketched in the attached    PlayItAgainSam_picture.pdf.
#
#   IMPORTANT:
#     1. Implement using ITERATIVE ENHANCEMENT:
#          -- Implement a bit and test that bit, getting it to work.
#          -- Implement a bit more and test it, getting it to work.
#          -- Etc until the entire program works corectly.
#
#     2. Put meaningful chunks of work into FUNCTIONS.
#        Do NOT put the entire program (i.e., all the code) in main!
#
#     3. Write and use TEST FUNCTIONS as needed (but only as needed).
#
#     4. Include BRIEF but MEANINGFUL comments AS YOU WRITE THE CODE.
